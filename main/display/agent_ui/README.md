# Agent UI firmware architecture

The firmware UI is organized as one runtime entry point, shared layers, and
vertical app slices. The directory map is:

```text
display/agent_ui/
├── agent_ui_runtime.*   runtime registration and global lifecycle
├── core/                 navigation, shell, theme, fonts, and device-wide UI
├── components/           reusable LVGL components and expression playback
├── apps/<app>/           app-owned contract, state, view, and integrations
└── sources.cmake         aggregate source and include-directory manifest
```

Each UI app is a vertical slice under `apps/<app>/`:

- `*_contract.h`: intents, events, commands, and shared app types;
- `*_view_state.h`: complete render state with no LVGL or hardware handles;
- `*_controller.*`: state transitions and intent/event handling;
- `*_adapter.*`: access to existing business and hardware services;
- `*_view.*`: LVGL creation, rendering, and intent emission;
- `*_module.*`: wiring between the controller, adapter, view, and navigation.

The Network slice is embedded in Settings rather than registered as a
standalone navigation screen:

```text
apps/network/
├── network_contract.h       intents, events, and commands
├── network_view_state.h     renderable network state
├── network_controller.*     state transitions and user intent handling
├── network_adapter.*        Wi-Fi, cellular, and storage service access
├── network_module.*         Settings integration boundary
├── network_view.*           LVGL composition and rendering
└── network_*_ui.*           reusable settings panels and dialogs
```

`network_view.*` and the `network_*_ui.*` helpers only render state and emit
callbacks. Hardware, storage, network, and modem operations belong in the
adapter and are coordinated by the controller and module.

The Bluetooth slice is also embedded in Settings and keeps the external audio
module behind an explicit boundary:

```text
apps/bluetooth/
├── bluetooth_contract.h       intents, commands, events, and device types
├── bluetooth_view_state.h     renderable connection and scan state
├── bluetooth_controller.*     intent and lifecycle coordination
├── bluetooth_adapter.*        UART protocol, NVS, audio route, and tasks
├── bluetooth_view.*           LVGL rendering and intent emission
├── bluetooth_settings_ui.*    Bluetooth settings controls
└── bluetooth_module.*         lifecycle and dependency wiring
```

Mode changes follow the audio module protocol sequence and are completed by
the matching `SET MODE` response. Mode 2 accepts both a device selected from
the scan results and a reconnect reported by the module. Other uncorrelated
success responses do not change the current route. Once SLC confirms the
control link, the app selects A2DP music mode by default for ordinary Bluetooth
speakers. Call mode remains an explicit option that requests the SCO path for
compatible headset playback and microphone input. `SETUP SCO` confirms the
call audio path.
A device-level disconnect returns the module to Mode 1, restores the local
audio route, and resumes wake-word processing after the local I2S
acknowledgement.

The Camera slice is a top-level app with a complete vertical boundary:

```text
apps/camera/
├── camera_contract.h              intents, events, and commands
├── camera_view_state.h            renderable camera state
├── camera_controller.*            state transitions and intent handling
├── camera_adapter.*               command execution and service integration
├── camera_capture_backend.*       sensor capture and preview frame delivery
├── camera_gallery_repository.*    photo storage, metadata, and gallery entries
├── camera_image_codec.*           RGB565 and JPEG conversion
├── camera_image_decoder.*         asynchronous JPEG and viewer decoding
├── camera_view.*                  LVGL composition and user intent emission
└── camera_module.*                lifecycle and dependency wiring
```

`camera_view.*` owns LVGL objects, review and gallery layout, and draw-post
acknowledgements. Capture hardware, preview buffers, storage, JPEG encoding,
and asynchronous decoding stay behind the backend, repository, codec, decoder,
and adapter boundaries. Camera runtime registration uses `camera::Module`; the
runtime does not construct `CameraView` directly.

The Camera gallery lists the newest 48 regular `.jpg`/`.jpeg` files on the SD
card (case-insensitive extension matching). Older entries are intentionally
omitted to bound LVGL card and thumbnail memory; a missing older file is not a
decode failure.

Dependencies must flow in these directions:

```text
View -> shared components -> design tokens
Controller -> contract <- Adapter
Module -> View + Controller + Adapter
```

Controllers must not include LVGL. Adapters must not retain View or LVGL
pointers. Views must not access `Application`, NVS, network, storage, camera,
AT commands, or protocol clients directly. App-specific rendering helpers stay
under their app directory; only behavior that has no app ownership belongs in
`components/`.

## Runtime integration

`agent_ui::Runtime` owns top-level app registration and lifecycle dispatch. The
Home slice uses the complete Controller, Adapter, Module, and View boundary.
Its View composes `agent_ui::home::Renderer`, which only draws LVGL state and
emits intents; it does not call navigation or `Application` directly. Network
is owned by Settings and is consumed through the Network module's
`BuildInto`, `ResetUi`, and `LifecycleCallback` interface instead of a
`ScreenId` registration. Bluetooth uses the same embedded Module boundary.
Camera is registered through its Module mount factory
and receives lifecycle events through the same runtime boundary.

Each top-level app is registered by `agent_ui::Runtime`; embedded apps are
owned by their host module. Every app keeps its source manifest in
`apps/<app>/sources.cmake`. A View-only app may remain a View-only slice until
its business behavior needs a Controller or Adapter; it must still obey the
same dependency directions. Add new sources to the app manifest and include
that manifest from `display/agent_ui/sources.cmake`.

## Source and validation rules

- Edit `expression-spec.json` in the Demo and regenerate
  `components/expression_spec.generated.h` when expression timing changes.
- Keep hardware, storage, networking, and protocol work in app integrations or
  the existing device services; shared components must remain device-agnostic.
- Run a source-manifest check before a firmware build:

  ```powershell
  # Run from the repository root.
  node --test design\agent\tests\agent-ui-architecture.test.cjs
  ```

- Camera UI changes also require the architecture and visual-parity contracts:

  ```powershell
  node --test design\agent\tests\camera-ui-architecture.test.cjs design\agent\tests\camera-ui-visual-parity.test.cjs
  ```

  A full ESP32 build is required when a firmware source changes, but this
  contract check does not replace it.
